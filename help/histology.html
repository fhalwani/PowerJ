<p class="h1">The Histology Panel</p>
<p>The histology panel is a separate screen in the dashboard that can be accessed by clicking the mouse on the tabs panel, or by pressing the hotkeys (Alt-C or Alt-H).  It displays the workflow in the four histology workstations, namely embedding, microtomy, staining and routing stations.  Each chart  summarizes two distinct types of information: Number of backlog items (blocks or slides) and the amount of added versus completed tasks. Since the scale for item count differs from that of backlog count, there are <U><B>two Y-axes</B></U> set in the chart. The primary Y-axis on the left, is used for the added and completed tasks, whereas the secondary Y-axis on the right is used for backlog counts. The x-axis represents the date in a short format (day/month)</p>
