<p class="h1">The Turnaround Time Gauge (TAT)</p>
<p>The fifth component in the dashboard (bottom right corner of the main screen) is the average amount of time, in hours, taken to complete a process. It is calculated based on the mean value of all the cases over the past seven days.  It is calculated from the time a case is accessioned to the time it completes a process, after adjusting for weekends and statutory holidays.  For example, if a case is accessioned on Friday at 6 pm, and grossed on Monday at 8 am, then its grossing turnaround time is 6 hours, which is 4 hours from 6 pm to 10 pm on Friday plus 2 hours from 6 am to 8 am on Monday.</p>

<p class="h2">Filtering:</p>
<p>You can restrict the gauge data to calculate the average TAT of a specific subset of cases by using 2 of the drop-down lists in the menubar (Facility and Status). See the <a HREF="menubar.html">"Menu Bar Help Page"</a> for further details.</p>
