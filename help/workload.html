<p class="h1">The Workload Chart</p>
<p>This is the chart that occupies the bottom end of the main screen. It provides a quick breakdown of the workload of completed tasks over the last 3 days.  It is formatted as stacked bars, with the top bar (light blue) showing the sum of tasks done today, the middle bar in medium blue representing yesterday's tasks, and the bottom bar in dark blue representing the tasks completed 3 days ago. The total height of each bar is the sum of tasks completed over the last 3 days.</p>
<BR>
<p class="h2">Chart Filtering:</p>
<p>You can restrict the Chart data to display only a specific subset of cases by using 2 of the drop-down lists in the menubar (Status and Specialty). See the <a HREF="menubar.html">"Menu Bar Help Page"</a> for further details.</p>
<BR>
<p class="h2">Formulas:</p>
<p>Workload is currently estimaed based on number of cases and specimens processed, and number of blocks and slides created or read.  A more robust system based on L4E or Path2Quality will follow in a future release.</p>
